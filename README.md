# CKA Practice Environment Next Gen!


Based on the origina repo [arush-sal/cka-practice-environment](https://github.com/arush-sal/cka-practice-environment) 
and integrating modification from [satomic/cka-practice-environment](https://github.com/satomic/cka-practice-environment) 
but with enough changes to warrent a name change (in my mind):

  * Using [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd) for the web terminal emulator.  Need a well maintained version.
  * Able to easily run local or in the cloud, with no dependency on docker-compose. (using Kustomize)
  * Map questions to the latest CKA exam ([V1.17 curriculum](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum/blob/master/CKA_Curriculum_V1.17.pdf), released Feb 4th, 2020)


## the MOSTLY DIFFERENCE from the original repo



thx the orginal repo [arush-sal/cka-practice-environment](https://github.com/arush-sal/cka-practice-environment) by [arush-sal](https://github.com/arush-sal), it's awesome! but hard to use it.
- only support visit the CKA practice environment with URL `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1`, that's **TOO BAD**, cause this constraint, you can **only use MacBook or CentOS/Ubuntu Desktop verison**, if you wanna use a VM on a Cloud, and visit the environment from your local browser, there is no way for you.
- and based on my fork, you can **provision the CKA practice environment on a Cloud VM, than visit it with its PUBLIC IP from your local browser**, that's pretty cool

## Quick Start (needn't clone the repo)
**you must install docker before do this**. just copy and paste these shells from the two steps, then visit it from your local browser

### Step 1: Frontend (webpage)
```
# you need to change these two env to your real value, if you have no public ip, just set the PUBLIC_IP same as your PRIVATE_IP
export PUBLIC_IP=47.52.219.131
export PRIVATE_IP=172.31.63.194

# install docker-compose 
wget https://www.cnrancher.com/download/compose/v1.23.2-docker-compose-Linux-x86_64
mv v1.23.2-docker-compose-Linux-x86_64 docker-compose
chmod +x docker-compose
mv docker-compose /usr/local/bin/
docker-compose -v

# gen docker-compose.yaml and up it
cat > docker-compose.yaml << EOF
version: "3"

services:

  gateone:
    image: satomic/gateone:http
    ports:
    - "8000:8000"
    hostname: kubectl
    networks:
    - frontend
    volumes:
    - ssh_key:/root/.ssh/
    - /root/.kube/:/root/.kube/

  lab:
    image: satomic/cka_lab
    entrypoint: /opt/entry.bash
    ports:
      - 80:80
    networks:
    - frontend
    environment:
      GATEONE_HTTP_SERVER: "${PUBLIC_IP}:8000"

networks:
  frontend: {}
volumes:
  ssh_key: {}
EOF

docker-compose up -d

docker ps -a | grep satomic
```

### Step 2: Backend (k8s)

**if you already have Kubernetes Cluster**, just copy your `kubeconfig.yaml` file contents to the `/root/.kube/config` file in the host for his CKA Practice Environment.
```
# maybe some command like
cp /pathto_your_existed/kubeconfig.yaml /root/.kube/config
```

otherwise you can use [Rancher k3s](https://k3s.io/) to provision a mini Kubernetes to use.
```
# provision k8s (k3s)
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="--no-deploy traefik" sh -

# check it
kubectl get node

# copy kubeconfig to /root/.kube/config
cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml /root/.kube/config
sed -i "s/localhost/$(echo $PRIVATE_IP)/g" /root/.kube/config

kubectl --kubeconfig /root/.kube/config get node
```


## Getting the environment up and ready

### 1. install `docker-compose`
Make sure that you have docker-compose installed([installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)). Or you can run the `install-docker-compose.sh` shell scripts.
```
sh install-docker-compose.sh
```

### 2. up it

assume the **PUBLIC IP/PRIVATE IP** of your host (maybe a VM) is `47.52.219.131/172.31.63.194`, you need to change the `environment` values of `GATEONE_HTTP_SERVER` in the file `docker-compose.yaml` or `docker-compose-builder.yaml`

example:
```
version: "3"

services:

  gateone:
    image: satomic/gateone:http
    ports:
    - "8000:8000"
    hostname: kubectl
    networks:
    - frontend
    volumes:
    - ssh_key:/root/.ssh/

  lab:
    image: satomic/cka_lab
    entrypoint: /opt/entry.bash
    ports:
      - 80:80
    networks:
    - frontend
    environment:
      GATEONE_HTTP_SERVER: "47.52.219.131:8000" # you need to change this IP based on your real PUBLIC IP

networks:
  frontend: {}
volumes:
  ssh_key: {}
```
 
To start the lab environment you can do either of the following two:

#### To use the prebuilt images
run
```
docker-compose up -d
```
and point your browser to `http://47.52.219.131`

#### To build the images yourself locally 
run
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-builder.yaml up -d
```
and point your browser to `http://47.52.219.131`


### 3. provision k8s (k3s)

#### **if you already have Kubernetes Cluster**
copy your `kubeconfig` file contents to the `/root/.kube/config` file in the host for his CKA Practice Environment.
```
# maybe some command like
cp /pathto_your_existed/kubeconfig.yaml /root/.kube/config
```

#### Rancher k3s
otherwise you can use [Rancher k3s](https://k3s.io/) to provision a mini Kubernetes to use.
```
export PRIVATE_IP=172.31.63.194

curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="--no-deploy traefik" sh -

# check it
kubectl get node

# copy kubeconfig to /root/.kube/config
cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml /root/.kube/config
sed -i "s/localhost/$(echo $PRIVATE_IP)/g" /root/.kube/config

kubectl --kubeconfig /root/.kube/config get node
```

## Uninstall
```
docker-compose down
/usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh
```
